# LinkMapper

LinkMapper is a link map analysis tool written in Swift. Thanks to Concurrency and TabularData, LinkMapper can generate a table summary from 300+ MB link map in less 1 minute!

LinkMapper contains Swift models and sample logic for parsing link maps and building an object-symbol relationship graph (or tree). This should be handy if you wanted to develop other tools that extends or builds upon LinkMapper.
